Life is
Time you enjoy wasting was
Love is 
All you need is 
God is 
All we are saying is 
Everything is 
Music is 
Our society is 
One thing you can't hide is
There's nowhere you can be that isn't 
living is 
It's weird not to be 
Nothing is
War is
Avant-garde is 
Before Elvis there was 
Paranoia is
Let it be
Imagine
Happiness is
The world is
I am
