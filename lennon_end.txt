what happens while you are busy making other plans.
a great woman behind every idiot.
not wasted.
the flower you've got to let grow.
the answer, and you know that for sure.
love.
a concept by which we measure our pain.
give peace a chance.
clearer when you're in love.
everybody's possession.
run by insane people for insane objectives.
when you're crippled inside.
easy with eyes closed.
real.
over ... If you want it.
everybody's business.
French for bullshit.
the greatest refreshment in life.
nothing.
just a heightened sense of awareness.
a warm gun.
just how you feel when you don't feel miserable.
still spinning and so are we and so are you.
the Walrus.
